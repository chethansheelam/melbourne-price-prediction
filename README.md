üìã 1. Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end machine learning workflow to accurately predict house prices in Melbourne, Australia. The process includes thorough data cleaning, in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning of an XGBoost model. The final, high-performance model is deployed as a user-friendly, interactive web application using Streamlit.

Live Application: https://melbournepriceprediction.streamlit.app

‚ú® 2. Key Features
Advanced Data Cleaning: Handled significant missing values using sophisticated imputation techniques, such as filling missing Landsize and YearBuilt with the median values of their respective suburbs.

In-Depth Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted a comprehensive EDA to uncover market trends. Visualizations included:

A geospatial map using Folium to plot property prices across Melbourne.

A correlation heatmap to understand relationships between numerical features.

Time-series analysis to track median prices over time.

Strategic Feature Engineering: Created impactful new features, such as Property Age (from YearBuilt) and applied log transformations to skewed variables (Price, Landsize) to improve model stability and performance.

High-Performance Modeling: Utilized an XGBoost Regressor, with its hyperparameters optimized using RandomizedSearchCV to maximize predictive accuracy on unseen data.

Interactive Deployment: Built and deployed a user-friendly Streamlit web application that allows for real-time price predictions based on user-selected property features.

üöÄ 3. Model Performance
The final tuned model achieved the following performance on the unseen test set:

R-squared (R¬≤): 0.8842 (The model successfully explains 88.4% of the variance in house prices).

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~$138,000 (The model's predictions are, on average, off by this amount).
